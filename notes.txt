history -- should not be repeating 
- execute certain lines of code 

don't make it more complicated to use a pattern 

assume human first -- then make adaptions 
set up board 5x5 -- initialize players 

minimum unit of code - turn 
implement things in terms of a turn so that you can repeat turns
no upper limit to how many turns -- while loop 
need to check for win condition after every turn 

game ends -- print who as won, ask to play again

hueristic -- human player but uk input
- don't work on until game with human players works

modules ex. 
- board
- players
- hueristic
- main 
    - calling dif functions from dif modules
- cli 
    - take inpit & transform into function calls 
- santorini game controller 

-- ask to explain design patterns very simply
